### Homework 4 ###
Here is the [link](https://github.com/nmurzin/devops_online/blob/master/homeworks/HomeWork-4.jpg) to homework task.

My implementation looks a little bit weird, cause I was lazy and didn't want to distribute Dockerfile from scm. 

How to:  
1. Run jenkins docker container
2. Install necessary plugins(docker, docker pipelines)
3. Add credentials for docker-hub
4. Copy pipeline to your job from `Jenkinsfile`

@TODO
* It would be better to setup all Jenkins environment(jobs, pipelines, plugins) from one config file
